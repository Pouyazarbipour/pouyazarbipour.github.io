# My Journey
#
Currently a **Graduate Research Assistant** in **Dr. Mohammad Reza Nikoo**’s lab at **Sultan Qaboos University, Oman** (Jun. 2025 – Present), where he implements machine learning and deep learning techniques in ocean engineering applications and conducts uncertainty quantification in water engineering. Pouya Zarbipour-Lakposhteh received his M.Sc. in Civil Engineering (Coastal, Port, and Marine Structures) from [Tarbiat Modares University](https://modares.ac.ir/en) in February 2024 (GPA: 15.03/20, thesis grade: Excellent 19.25/20) and his Associate’s Degree and B.Sc. in Civil Engineering (Construction and Execution) from **Technical and Vocational University (TVU)**, Tehran, in February 2020 (GPA: 14.94/20).
#
He has extensive experience in reliability analysis, risk assessment, Reliability-Based Design Optimization (RBDO), causal inference, and AI-driven modeling of coastal and marine structures. His work includes probabilistic evaluation of desalination outfalls, Bayesian reliability design of reshaping berm breakwaters, quantum machine learning for wave overtopping, harmful algal bloom prediction, and development of more than 10 Python-based tools for coastal engineering applications. He also serves as **Supervisor and Executive Engineer** at the Iran Construction Engineering Organization (IRCEO) and previously worked as Graduate Teaching & Research Assistant at Tarbiat Modares University and Coastal Hyd Lab under Prof. Mehdi Shafieefar and Dr. Hassan Akbari. He is an Ad Hoc Reviewer for *Water Research* (Elsevier, IF: 12.4, Q1).
#
With strong proficiency in Python, MATLAB, Fortran, and specialized software (UQLab, MIKE Zero, Delft3D, CORMIX, ArcGIS Pro, Google Earth Engine, SAP2000, PLAXIS 3D, GeoStudio), he combines advanced computational skills with practical construction supervision and academic teaching experience.
