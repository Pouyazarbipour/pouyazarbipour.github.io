## [Sediment Transport Calculator GUI](https://github.com/Pouyazarbipour/Sediment-Transport-Calculator)

The **Sediment Transport Calculator** is a MATLAB-based graphical user interface (GUI) application designed to compute sediment transport rates using common coastal engineering equations. This tool is useful for researchers, engineers, and students working in coastal engineering and sediment transport studies.

## Groin Simulation GUI

This MATLAB app simulates the deposition of sand on the updrift side and the erosion of sand on the downdrift side of a groin. The simulation uses a one-line contour model to calculate and visualize shoreline evolution over time.
- **Deposition & Erosion Modeling:** Simulates the deposition of sand on the updrift side and erosion on the downdrift side of a groin.
- **Dynamic Visualization:** Displays the shoreline evolution and real-time sediment transport (Q) as the simulation progresses.
- **Groin Influence:** Calculates the critical distance (`xm`) and when the groin starts bypassing sand (i.e., when the groin reaches its capacity).

## Beach Simulation GUI Model

This MATLAB project provides a simulation tool to analyze and visualize beach profiles under native and filled conditions. The model calculates key beach metrics, including depth, volume, and maximum profile extent, based on user-defined input parameters. It is particularly useful for coastal engineering applications such as beach nourishment design and sediment transport studies.
- Simulates native and filled beach profiles.
- Computes beach volume and maximum horizontal extent.
- Provides customizable input parameters for grain size, berm height, and closure depth.
- Visualizes native and filled beach profiles with clear, labeled plots.
- Outputs key metrics to the MATLAB console.

## Inlet Tide Calculator GUI

The **Inlet Tide Calculator** is a MATLAB-based graphical user interface (GUI) designed to simulate the tidal dynamics of a lagoon or bay connected to the ocean through an inlet. The app calculates the bay's tide response, considering factors such as inlet geometry, energy losses, and tidal propagation time. It uses **Keulegan's method** and the **Runge-Kutta 4th order integration** to solve for the tidal dynamics and visualize the results.
- **Tidal Wave Calculation**: Computes the tidal response in a bay, considering inlet geometry and energy losses.
- **Graphical User Interface**: Interactive GUI to input parameters and view results.
- **Visualization**: Plots both ocean and bay tides with corresponding phase lag.
- **Results Display**: Displays the repletion coefficient (K), phase lag (in degrees), and response ratio of the bay tide to the ocean tide.

## Wave Calculator GUI

The **Wave Calculator GUI** is a MATLAB-based GUI tool designed to compute various wave parameters such as wave length, wave speed, wave height, and others based on user-provided inputs. The tool provides an interactive interface for entering wave properties and displays calculated results dynamically. This application is useful for students, researchers, and engineers working in fields such as oceanography, coastal engineering, and marine structures. 

- **Interactive GUI**:  
  A user-friendly interface with input fields, dropdown menus, and buttons for calculations.  

- **Customizable Inputs**:  
  Enter wave height, period or frequency, wave angle, and local water depth.  

- **Calculated Parameters**:  
  - Wave length (`L`)  
  - Wave number (`k`)  
  - Wave speed (`C`)  
  - Group velocity (`Cg`)  
  - Shoaling coefficient (`Ks`)  
  - Refraction coefficient (`Kr`)  
  - Resultant wave height (`H`)  
  - Bottom orbital velocity (`u_b`)
  - more Parameters

- **Error Handling**:  
  Input validation ensures that only valid numeric values are accepted. Errors are displayed via pop-up dialogs.  

- **Reset Functionality**:  
  Resets all inputs and outputs to their default values.
